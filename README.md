## Hello guys 👋 I am Junior Maciel.

<!--
**junior-maciel/junior-maciel** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I'm a Designer (for over 10 years) and I live in [João Pessoa](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Pessoa), in the northeast of Brazil. Currently I'm a Design Technologist at [Philips](https://www.philips.com/global), working remotely with the Blumenau team on innovation projects for the health area. I have worked on digital projects for Cidade Viva, Davus Engenharia, TocaLivros, Global Commons Review, SOGO - Government Solutions, Hofmann Station, ClubKids Aluguel de Brinquedos, Adoleta Brinquedos, designing digital experiences to improve communication between users and their businesses.

Today I work on the definition and management of some design processes within the design team at Philips Blumenau, connecting developers and designers for the sake of productive efficiency, ensuring that all those responsible for a project are aware of their deliverables and results for the creation of digital products.
